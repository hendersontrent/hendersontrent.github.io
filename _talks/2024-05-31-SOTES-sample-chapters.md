citation: 'First three unedited chapters for my epic fantasy novel Shadow of the Eternal Sun. Shadow of the Eternal Sun tells the story of a tabletop roleplaying game campaign I ran for two-and-a-half years. The narrative is set in my own expansive world complete with a unique magic system, whose rich arcane and political history spans millennia. The players at my table who shaped the story through their characters were from similarly rich walks of life: different sexualities, genders, and Indigenous status were safely and thoughtfully represented. This appreciation for the inherit diversity which exists in our world flows directly into mine to tell an intensely mature, character-driven, cosmos-spanning story free of racism, sexual abuse, and gender-driven social structures. Although its cast of point-of-view characters is diverse, ultimately, Shadow of the Eternal Sun follows a group of reluctant companions who learn through trials of their burgeoning powers that the nature of their coalescence is deeper and far more sinister than simple happenstance. Such is the way when the machinations of gods both known and unknown to the pantheon are revealed. Around the group of companions, numerous smaller and deeply personal stories are told – stories of emotional maturation, grief, sexual identity, religiosity, intellectual inquest, and the reverberating impact of the decisions made by one’s family.'
