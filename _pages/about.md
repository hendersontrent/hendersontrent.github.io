I am a final year PhD student in statistics in the Dynamics and Neural Systems Group at The University of Sydney under the supervision of [Dr. Ben Fulcher](http://www.benfulcher.com/). I am principally interested in methods and applications of [time-series features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08055)---properties which can reduce a time series down to a single summary statistic. Time-series features are particularly interesting to me as I am a firm believer in interpretable modelling---and time-series features (such as the value of the autocorrelation function at lag 1) are just that, meaning temporal differences in data can be well understood. My research has largely focused on using time-series features in machine learning applications, such as classification problems.

A substantial portion of my work (and probably my deepest academic passion!) has involved building open-source software. So far, throughout my PhD I have developed [theft](https://hendersontrent.github.io/theft/) (Tools for Handling Extraction of Features from Time series), [Rcatch22](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22) (calculation of 22 CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics), [correctR](https://hendersontrent.github.io/correctR/) (corrected test statistics for comparing machine learning models on correlated samples), [PosteriorPlots.jl](https://github.com/hendersontrent/PosteriorPlots.jl) (graphical tools for Bayesian inference and posterior predictive checks), and [QuasiGLM.jl](https://github.com/hendersontrent/QuasiGLM.jl) (adjustments for Poisson and Binomial Generalised Linear Models to their quasi equivalents for dispersed data).

Outside of my direct research, I am also working on [GAM.jl](https://github.com/hendersontrent/GAM.jl)---an ambitious attempt to build [generalised additive models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model) in native Julia using as similar of an interface as possible to R's incredible [mgcv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html) package. It turns out that the linear algebra required to do this is very hard...

### Professional background

I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at the management consulting firm [Nous Group](https://nousgroup.com/people/trent-henderson/) where I have worked for over 5 years. My role is quite diverse, but I most often find myself working on large and complex program evaluations for the Australian Government which required detailed data linkage, rigorous causal inference, and statistical modelling. I also develop internal software packages for Nous and help maintain its large SQL data warehouse.

### Outside of work

I can usually be found writing and recording music for my band [The Archon Rift](https://thearchonrift.bandcamp.com/), editing my epic fantasy novel, running D&D campaigns, playing golf, or playing any number of RPGs.
