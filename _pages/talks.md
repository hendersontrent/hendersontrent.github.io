## Shadow of the Eternal Sun

Below, the first three unedited chapters for my epic fantasy novel *Shadow of the Eternal Sun* are available as a preview while I finish editing the book and engage literary agents for representation. Shadow of the Eternal Sun is the first book in my *Choir of the Cosmos* trilogy.

### One sentence summary

Multiple point-of-view epic fantasy on a cosmos-spanning scale, but with all the diverse, character-driven intimacies of a tabletop roleplaying campaign played amongst friends.

*For fans of Dungeons & Dragons, Critical Role, The Kingkiller Chronicle, Malazan Book of the Fallen, and The Stormlight Archive.*
